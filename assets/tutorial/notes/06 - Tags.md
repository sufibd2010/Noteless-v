# 06 - Tags

Notes can have multiple tags, which are useful for better categorization.

## Syntax

- **Root**: Root tags don't contain any forward slash (`/`), they will be rendered in the sidebar.

- **Nested**: Tags can also be nested, _indefinitely_, just write them like a path, separating the levels with a forward slash: `foo/bar/baz`.

## Collapse/Expand

Tags with children can be collapsed/expanded, just click the arrow next to them.

## Editing

There are multiple ways to add/remove tags:

- **Single-note editing**: You can edit a note's tags via the popup menu in the toolbar.
- **Multi-note editing**: Tags can be added/removed from multiple notes at once via the [multi-note editing](@note/07 - Multi-Note Editing.md) features provided.
- **Advanced search & replace**: Alternatively you could just open your data directory with your editor and perform a search & replace there, this way you can also use advanced features like regexes.
