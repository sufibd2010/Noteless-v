# 03 - The Main Page

The main page shows you all notes contained in the currently active category, properly ordered and filtered by the search query.

## Search

To search just click on the top right icon and type something in the search bar.

The content of notes is searched in too, a full-match is always required.

## New Note Button

On the bottom right there's a button for creating a new note.

## Sorting Order

Right below the title bar you can change the order in which notes are being displayed.

By default this is by `Title - Ascending`, so that the tutorial notes get displayed in order, but you might want to change this later to `Date Modified - Descending`, so that the most recently edited notes are at the top.

## Notes

Lastly there's the notes list.

Notes will have some badges if they are pinned, favorited or have attachments.

Pinned notes are displayed before the others.

If you long-press them you can access some commands, all of them are also available by sliding a note to the side, most of them are also available from the editor's toolbar.
