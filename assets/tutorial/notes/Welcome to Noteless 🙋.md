## About

Noteless is a markdown note-taking app which aims to be compatible with notes saved in [Notable](https://notable.app/).

## Tutorial

Some tutorial notes have been added to your data directory.

They will guide you towards the main features Noteless provides.

You can read them in a nicer way by pressing the switch in the toolbar.

Once you're done exploring feel free to permanently delete them, if at any point you'd like to read them again you can re-add them to your data directory via the `Settings -> More -> Recreate tutorial notes` option.

## Credits

This tutorial notes are based on the ones in [Notable](https://notable.app/).
