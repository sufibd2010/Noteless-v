# 10 - Version Control

Noteless doesn't have version control built-in, but since the data directory is just a regular directory you could make it a git repository and every once in a while take a snapshot of your notes, or perhaps a small script could make commits automatically for you everytime something changes.

You have to use an external data directory for this via `Settings -> Data Directory`.
