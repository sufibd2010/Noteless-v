# 02 - The Sidebar

The sidebar lists all your tags and you can access the Settings from there.

It can be opened by clicking the hamburger icon in the top left corner or by swiping from the left edge.


## Categories

- **All Notes**: This section contains all notes.
- **Favorites**: This section contains all notes you've favorited.
- **Untagged**: This section contains all notes that have no tags.
- **Trash**: This section contains all notes that have been deleted. These notes won't be displayed in any other category.
- **All your other tags**

You can create sub-categories by using nested tags. (`tag/subtag`)
