# 07 - Multi-Note Editing

## Built-in

Some multi-note editing features are built-in.

To select multiple notes, you need to **long-press** one and then simply **press** others to remove and add them. You can also use the `ALL` and `NONE` selectors which appear in the multi-note editing toolbar on the bottom.

The selection is persisted if you change categories via the sidebar or search for notes, so you can perform advanced selections.

These are the actions you can take on selected notes:

- Favorite/unfavorite them.
- Pin/unpin them.
- Move to trash/restore/permanently delete them.
- Add one or multiple tags to them.
- Remove one or multiple tags from them.

## Advanced

If you need more advanced multi-note editing, like global search & replace, remember that your notes are just plain Markdown files.

You could open your data directory into your favorite editor of choice and perform the search & replace there, this way you can also use advanced features like regexes.

All the edits performed with a third-party application will be reflected into Noteless after a quick refresh.
